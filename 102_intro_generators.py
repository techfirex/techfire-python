# generators are iterators
# generator use less memory because its generator sequence one by one
# increase performance

# when we have to use again and again data from sequence then use list - iterables
# for one time use sequence then use generators - iterator

# memeory ---- [...................] - list case
# memory ---- (1) - generator case 
# memory ---- (2) - remove first and generate second in memory and print

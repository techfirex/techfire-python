# array - ordered collection of items
# store fixed data - integers, strings etc
# java, c, c++

# list - ordered collection of items
# python 
# store anything - flexible

# python array module - fix data type store
# numpy arrays - for data science - binding with c lang so that is works faster

# c & c++ is fast language/low level lang and python is slow language/high level language but we can make python faster by binding c language.

# javascript array = python list / flexible
